- divisible by three or seven

- sum of first 100 integers

- sum of all odd numbers between 1 to n.

- multi of first 100 integers

- sum of first 100 integers

- multiplication table

- sum of all elements in a list

- sum of all individual digits from a list of integer

- Write a program which takes a number as input from user (n) and prints the sum of only multiples of three or five from 1-n, e.g. 3+5+6+9+10+12+15 for n=17

- Write a function that takes a list as input and returns the elements on odd positions in a list.

- Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.

- Write a function which takes a list as input, and returns the reverse of that list as output.

- Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.

- Write a function which takes as input two lists and returns a new list with elements of both those two lists.

- Write a function that takes a number and prints a list of its digits. Eg. if number is 250, then it should print:

2
5
0

- replicate len()'s logic

- Define a function overlapping() that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least
one member in common, False otherwise. (break)

- Define a procedure histogram() that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the
screen. For example,histogram([4, 9, 7]) should print the following:

****
*********
*******

- Write a program that maps a list of words into a list of integers representing the lengths of the correponding words.

- Write a function find_longest_word() that takes a list of words and returns the length of
the longest one.

- Write a function filter_long_words() that takes a list of words and an integer n and
returns the list of words that are longer than n.

- A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least once,
for example: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Your task here is to write a
function to check a sentence to see if it is a pangram or not.

- character frequency

- Implement the 'Guess the number' game in Python. You will first set a particular integer as the final answer, and then ask the user to guess the number by taking his input. If the guess of the user is less than the final answer, print 'Your guess was less than the answer' and take input from the user again. Similarly, do the same if the guess is greater than the answer. If the guess is correct, print 'your guess is correct' and stop the program. Your program should keep on asking the user for his guess as long as he doesnt get the guess right.

- aaaaabaaaa = aba (remove redundant elements in a sequence)

- Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a list: using a for-loop, a while-loop and recursion. 

- Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,1,b,2,c,3] (assuming both lists are of equal lengths)

- Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements, e.g. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,1,b,2,c,3] (assuming both lists can be of varying lengths)

- Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.

- Write a function which will take a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list as output

- Write a function that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list. [1,4,6],[2,3,5] → [1,2,3,4,5,6]

- Write a function that takes a list of strings an prints them, one per line, in a rectangular frame. For example the list ["Hello", "World", "in", "a", "frame"] gets printed as:

*********
* Hello *
* World *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********

- Write a function which will take two integers as input, and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of those two numbers. (use the Euclid’s algorithm for the same)

- Display number of tries in Guess the number game

- Implement the merge sort
